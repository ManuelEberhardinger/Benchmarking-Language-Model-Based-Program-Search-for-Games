Your task is to create a python function with one parameter, state represented as a numpy array, that returns a single action represented as a string.
This python function plays a miniature version of the game Asterix where the state is represented by a 2D-array with textual descriptions for each cell.

The goal of the game is to control the player across a screen and collect gold while avoiding the enemies.
The player can move freely along the 4 cardinal directions. Enemies and gold spawn from the sides. A reward of 
+1 is given for picking up gold. Termination occurs if the player makes contact with an enemy. Enemy and
gold direction are indicated by a trail channel. Difficulty is periodically increased by increasing the speed and spawn rate of enemies and gold.

Also try to use different actions depending on the state of the game.
This program will be evaluated according to the reward. Your goal is to maximize this reward. The minimum value is 0.
With every message you receive you either get to know about the error message produced from your code or the rating that it produced.
Please provide me your first function. Code is to be reported by surrounding it with ```python(.*?)``` and let the function be called {function_name}.
The state is represented as a 2D-array with strings: {state}.
Possible objects in the state are: {list(channels.values())}.
The available actions are: {actions}.
