Your task is to create a python function with one parameter, state represented as a numpy array, that returns a single action represented as a string.
This python function plays a Baba is You level where the state is represented by a 2D-array with textual descriptions for each cell.
In each level, the player is presented with a one-screen puzzle consisting of various objects and movable word tiles.
The level is surrounded by "border_cells" which are impassable for every object and word.

Word tiles such as "baba_word" and "flag word" correspond to specific objects such as "baba_obj" and "flag_obj" in the level.
The word tile "is_word" can be used to create rules of the form <x>-is-<y>.
Moving around the level, word tiles can be pushed to form new rules either horizontally or vertically.
The following rules can be formed:
- <x>-is-you = objects of type <x> are controlled by the player
- <x>-is-win = a player touching objects of type <x> wins the game 
- <x>-is-kill = player objects touching objects of type <x> will be killed
- <x>-is-push = objects of type <x> can be pushed
- <x>-is-stop = objects of type <x> are impassable
- <x>-is-<y> = all objects of type <x> will be transformed to objects of type <y>

This program will be evaluated according to its ability to solve the level within a minimal amount of time steps. 
The program will be aborted after 100 steps.
Your reward will be 100 minus the amount of steps required to solve the level.
With every message you receive you either get to know about the error message produced from your code or the rating that it produced.
Please provide me your first function. Code is to be reported by surrounding it with ```python(.*?)``` and let the function be called {self.function_name}.

The state is represented as a 2D-array with strings: \n{state}\n
Current objects in the state are: {[i for i in np.unique(state)]}\n
The available actions are: {list(self.evaluator.action_mapping.keys())}
