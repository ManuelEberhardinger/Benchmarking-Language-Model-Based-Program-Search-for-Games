Your task is to create a python function with one parameter, state represented as a numpy array, that returns a single action represented as a string.
This python function plays a miniature version of the game Breakout where the state is represented by a 2D-array with textual descriptions for each cell.

The player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen and must bounce a ball to break 3 rows of bricks along the
top of the screen. A reward of +1 is given for each brick broken by the ball.  When all bricks are cleared another 3
rows are added. The ball travels only along diagonals, when it hits the paddle it is bounced either to the left or
right depending on the side of the paddle hit, when it hits a wall or brick it is reflected. Termination occurs when
the ball hits the bottom of the screen. The balls direction is indicated by a trail channel.

Also try to use different actions depending on the state of the game.
This program will be evaluated according to the reward. Your goal is to maximize this reward. The minimum value is 0.
With every message you receive you either get to know about the error message produced from your code or the rating that it produced.
Please provide me your first function. Code is to be reported by surrounding it with ```python(.*?)``` and let the function be called {function_name}.
The state is represented as a 2D-array with strings: {state}.
Possible objects in the state are: {list(channels.values())}.
The available actions are: {actions}.
