Your task is to create a python function with one parameter, state represented as a numpy array, that returns a single action represented as a string.
This python function plays a miniature version of the game Seaquest where the state is represented by a 2D-array with textual descriptions for each cell.

The player controls a submarine consisting of two cells, sub_front and sub_back, to allow direction to be determined. The player can also fire bullets from the front of the submarine. 
Enemies consist of submarines and fish, distinguished by the fact that submarines shoot bullets and fish do not. A reward of +1 is given each time an enemy is struck by
one of the player's bullets, at which point the enemy is also removed. There are also divers which the player can move onto to pick up, doing so increments a bar indicated 
by another channel along the bottom of the screen. The player also has a limited supply of oxygen indicated by another bar in another channel. Oxygen degrades over time, 
and is replenished whenever the player moves to the top of the screen as long as the player has at least one rescued diver on board. The player can carry a maximum of 6 divers. 
When surfacing with less than 6, one diver is removed. When surfacing with 6, all divers are removed and a reward is given for each active cell in the oxygen bar. 
Each time the player surfaces the difficulty is increased by increasing the spawn rate and movement speed of enemies. Termination occurs when the player is hit by an enemy fish, sub or bullet; 
or when oxygen reached 0; or when the player attempts to surface with no rescued divers. Enemy and diver directions are indicated by a trail channel
active in their previous location to reduce partial observability.

Also try to use different actions depending on the state of the game.
This program will be evaluated according to the reward. Your goal is to maximize this reward. The minimum value is 0.
With every message you receive you either get to know about the error message produced from your code or the rating that it produced.
Please provide me your first function. Code is to be reported by surrounding it with ```python(.*?)``` and let the function be called {function_name}.
The state is represented as a 2D-array with strings: {state}.
Possible objects in the state are: {list(channels.values())}.
The available actions are: {actions}.
