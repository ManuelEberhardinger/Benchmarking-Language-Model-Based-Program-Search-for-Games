Write a Python function to generate mazes called: {function_name}

The function signature should be:

def generate_maze(
    width: int,
    height: int,
    start: Tuple[int, int],
    end: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    pass

DO NOT include example usage of how to run the code in your generated code.

Hint: use random functions to control some aspects of the maze generation.

Hint: be sure that the start and end points have a value of 0.

The generate_maze function should generate random mazes that are on a specific size grid of width, height.
0 represents a passage and 1 represents a wall. There must be a path between the specified
start and end points.
The start and end points are represented as a tuple of (x, y) coordinates.
The start and end point cells must have a value of 0. 
The score is based on the length of the shortest path between the start
and the end points. The higher the score, the better the maze generation function.
The maze generation must be efficient for example a 10x10 maze should be generated in less than 0.1 seconds.
